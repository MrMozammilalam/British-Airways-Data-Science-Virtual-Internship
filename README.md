## The virtual Internship is divided into two main tasks 

1. Web scraping to gain company insights
2. Predicting customer buying behaviour

## Highlight
A project that allows you to put yourself in the position of a British Airways data scientist and finish activities that imitate the work that the data science team does daily. Building predictive models to forecast customer purchasing behaviour and analysing the scraped customer review data are the two activities that make up the project.



## Task 1: Unveiling Customer Sentiment through Web Scraping and Analysis.
Scrape and analyze customer review data to uncover findings for British Airways.
1. Challenge: Extracted unstructured data from https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways/ using web scraping techniques.
2. Action: Performed sentiment analysis on the reviews to categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral.
3. Impact: Gathered valuable insights into customer experiences and areas for improvement.
4. Presentation: Created a compelling PowerPoint presentation showcasing the findings and potential benefits for British Airways.


## Task 2: Predicting Customer Buying Behavior with Machine Learning.
Build a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behavior
1. Challenge: Developed a classification model to predict customer buying behavior based on various factors.
2. Action: Utilized my machine learning expertise to build and train the model for optimal predictive power.
3. Impact: This model could potentially empower British Airways to tailor their marketing strategies and offerings to specific customer segments.
4. Presentation: Created another insightful PowerPoint presentation outlining the model, its predictions, and potential business applications.

## Overall Experience:
This virtual internship was an exceptional learning experience. I honed my data scraping, sentiment analysis, and machine learning skills in a practical setting. Additionally, the opportunity to present my work in a professional format further strengthened my communication and presentation skills.

## Looking to the future:
I'm incredibly grateful for this chance to contribute to British Airways' data-driven initiatives. This experience has solidified my passion for data science and its ability to unlock valuable business insights. I'm eager to leverage this knowledge and continue developing my skills to make an impact in the industry.
